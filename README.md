# House-price-prediction-analysis
## Objective
In this final project, students will demonstrate their end-to-end skills in data scraping, data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation. The task involves predicting house prices using machine learning models. The following requirements outline the project details.

## Data Collection

- Data items are scraped and collected from the website [batdongsan.vn](https://batdongsan.vn/ban-nha/) to create a comprehensive dataset.
- Relevant information for each data item is gathered, ensuring a thorough exploration of the website.
- The size of the dataset to be collected is determined based on the availability of data and project requirements.

## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

- Appropriate data features are selected for training the models.
- Necessary data preprocessing steps are performed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Feature engineering techniques are applied to enhance the predictive power of the selected features.

## Methodology

- A heatmap based on the address of the listed house is visualized using kernel density estimation at a certain time.
- A methodology is designed to address the house price prediction problem, considering various approaches and techniques for data analysis and modeling.
- The chosen methodologies are justified, explaining their effectiveness.
- Recommended models include Linear/Ridge/Lasso Regression, Decision Tree/Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, among others. Advanced models and deep learning approaches using the PyTorch framework are encouraged if feasible.
- Relevant metrics for model evaluation are chosen to assess model performance.
- Multiple models are employed, and model benchmarks are performed to identify the best one for the problem.
